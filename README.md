## What's up? I'm Martin! (he/him) ✌️
I'm a creative problem solver with experience in full stack web development ⌨️ and UX design 🤔📝. Most of my work experience has been in front end, but I'm currently exploring backend technologies and expanding on my developer operation practices. On my free time, I like to lift heavy things and take aesthetic portrait photographs. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate or simply chat! 💡
